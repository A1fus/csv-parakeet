# Parakeet
A simple command line tool to convert csv files to parquet, and vice versa.

## Motivation
Current workflow is opening a Jupyter notebook, running Pandas read csv and writing to parquet, then closing the notebook again. The goal of this project is to simplify that process into a single command.
